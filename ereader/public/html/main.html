            <h3><p id='proposed'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a "Committee of Three Hundred" (one member </p>

A petition called "Artists against the Eiffel Tower" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Charles Alphand, and it was published by <i>Le Temps</i> on 14 February 1887: </p>

We shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.</p>
            <p id="construction">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: "My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?" These criticisms were also dealt with by Édouard Lockroy in an ironic letter of support for the artists, where he condemned the efforts as moot since construction had already begun and the matter decided.</p>
